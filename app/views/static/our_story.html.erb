    <h2>Our Story</h2>

    <p>How we met</p>
    <p>In the Fall of 2013, Kelsie's roommate and Sigma Kappa sister (and future wedding officiant!) Katherine convinced her to join Truman State University's Student Senate. Little did she know that the Senate's secretary, John Foley, was the cutest, sweetest, and funniest boy on campus! Although he called her name at the beginning of every meeting, they finally started talking at the Senate Christmas party (where Katherine made Kelsie wear a bearded hat) and, after hanging out over the holiday break, started dating at the beginning of 2014.</p>
    <p>Kelsie graduated that May and went to work in St. Louis, while John started his summer internship in Kansas City. The next year and a half they saw a LOT of highway 70 while driving to visit one another, and added three additions to their little family. In the Fall of 2014, John acquired two little kittens, the every scared Sprocket and her rambunctious sister Gizmo. A couple months later, when he was visiting her in St. Louis, they decided to go to an adoption event 'just to see.' After dropping her off at the event, John went across the street to get coffee and, when he got back, she had already fallen in love with the little black and white fluffy puppy who would become Ozzy. John got a full time job in Kansas City while Kelsie was still in St. Louis, but they continued to trek across the state of Missouri to visit one another every couple of weeks.</p>
    <p>Then he proposed</p>
    <p>John came to visit Kelsie a couple weeks before Thanksgiving in 2015. On Saturday, November 14th, they went to one of their favorite brunch places in Soulard and he mentioned that they should bring Ozzy to a park that day. Since it was unusually nice for November, Kelsie figured he wanted to go to the dog park to let Ozzy run around, but no. John wanted to go to a nice park, he said. So they picked Ozzy up and walked to Lafayette Park.</p>
    <p>John pointed out the large bridge in the park, and they decided to walk across it. In the middle, he stopped, got down on one knee, and asked her to marry him. Kelsie knows that he said much more, but was already too excited to remember anything! Of course she said yes, and the happy couple finally started living in the same city a few weeks later.</p>
    <p>Their first "son" was born in March of 2016, and eight weeks later they drove 9 hours to pick up Henri the Welsh Corgi and bring him to his new home with his sisters. Although John and Kelsie love their wild and four-legged children, they are done getting anymore pets for the time being.</p>
    <p>John and Kelsie finally settled in St. Louis last November, and love city living (although their parents would have probably preferred that they had moved to the suburbs). </p>
